Katzebase is an ACID compliant document-based database written in .net 7 that runs on Windows or Linux. By default It can run as a service but the libraries can also be embedded. It basically supports what youâ€™d expect from a typical relational-database-management-system except the "rows" are stored as json and the schema is not fixed. The engine is wrapped by MVC controllers and allows access via APIs, a SQL like syntax or by using the bundled management UI (which calls the APIs).
